    <h2>A QUICK RECIPE NOTE</h2>
    <h3>Sinigang is a sour soup native to the Philippines. This recipe uses pork as the main ingredient. Other proteins and seafood can also be used. Beef, shrimp, fish are commonly used to cook sinigang. The chicken version, on the other hand, is called sinampalukang manok. I prefer to use either pork belly or buto-buto when cooking sinigang. The latter refers to cuts with bones intact. These are either pork neck bones, chopped spare ribs, and chopped baby back ribs. Pork shoulder and ham can also be used when cooking sinigang.</h5>

  <h3>STEP 1: PREPARING THE INGREDIENTS</h3>
  <ol>
    <img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/04/Cook-Sinigang-Na-Baboy-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/aid6422655-v4-728px-Cook-Sinigang-Na-Baboy-Step-1-Version-2.jpg" 
    alt=""
    height="500"
    width="500">
    <H3>Choose the souring agent.</H3>

      Tamarind is the most traditional souring agent used for sinigang na baboy. You can prepare the soup with fresh tamarind or use a powdered tamarind-flavored sinigang mix.
      When using fresh tamarind, you'll need 10 to 15 standard pieces of fruit. When using powdered flavoring, you'll need 1 1/2 packages, each weighing 1.41 ounces (40 g). 
      You can also use 3.5 ounces (99 g) of commercially prepared tamarind pulp, if you can find it. Even though tamarind is the most common and conventional souring agent, you could also use guava, bilimbi fruit, pineapple, green mango, calamansi, or wild mangosteen. 
      Other flavors of powdered sinigang mix could work in equal portions, as well.

      </ol>
      
  <h3>STEP 2: CUT PORK INTO PIECES</h3>
  <ol>
    <img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4d/Cook-Sinigang-Na-Baboy-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/aid6422655-v4-728px-Cook-Sinigang-Na-Baboy-Step-2-Version-2.jpg"

    height="500"
    width="500">
    <h3>Rinse the pork and pat it dry with clean paper towels, then cut it into 2 in (5.1 cm) cubes. </h3>

    You can use different cuts of pork for this soup, but the most common are pork belly and pork ribs. 
    Cuts of pork that include the bone (like spareribs) will add more flavor to the broth. You can also mix and match different cuts to vary the flavor.

  <h3>STEP 3: SLICE THE VEGETABLES</h3>
  <ol>
    <img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e3/Cook-Sinigang-Na-Baboy-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid6422655-v4-728px-Cook-Sinigang-Na-Baboy-Step-3-Version-2.jpg" 
    alt=""
    height="500"
    width="500">
  <H3>Slice the vegetables. Rinse the vegetables and pat them dry with clean paper towels. Chop each one into serving portions.</H3>
  
        <li>Cut the onion and tomato into wedges or quarters. Peel the taro, and cut it into wedges or quarters, as well.</li>
        <li>Cut the string beans into 2 in (5.1 cm) pieces, or trim the ends and tie the beans into knots.</li>
        <li>Chop the peppers and separate the water spinach or bok choy into individual leaves.</li>
        <li>Slice the eggplant into 1 in (2.5 cm) slices on the diagonal. Peel and slice the radish into 1⁄2 in (1.3 cm) rounds.</li>
  </ol>

    alt=""
    height="500"
    width="500">
  <H3>Heat the oil. Pour 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of vegetable oil into a large saucepan with deep sides. Set it over medium-high heat.</H3>
  </ol>

  <h3>STEP 5: BROWN THE PORK </h3>

    width="500">
  <H3>
    Brown the pork. Add the pork pieces to the hot oil. Cook, stirring frequently, for 4 minutes or until the majority of the pork browns on all sides.</H3>
    <li>If the saucepan has a narrow bottom, you may need to brown the pork in 2 separate batches. Ideally, most of the pieces should be able to touch the bottom of the pan as you brown them.</li>
    <li>After the pork browns, transfer it from the pan to a separate dish. Set it aside and cover it with foil or a lid to keep it warm.</li>
  </ol>
